# Quicky
Our project aims to connect volunteers with people in need during small disasters, such as natural disasters or accidents. Through our platform, volunteers can easily sign up and offer their assistance to those in need, while those affected by the disaster can request help from volunteers. Our goal is to create a community of support and kindness in times of crisis.
